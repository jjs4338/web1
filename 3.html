<h1>JAVASCRIPT이란 무엇인가></h1>
<p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[9] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[10] JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[11] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] Most web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
